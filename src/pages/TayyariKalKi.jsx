    description={<>A country like India, with a huge young population, can reap tremendous benefits from its demographic dividend if its youth are better skilled and employable. According to estimates, India’s demographic dividend window opened in 2005-06 and is expected to last until the mid-2050s. By 2047, India will have 1.1 billion people in the working age group (15-64), representing the peak of this demographic dividend. The next two decades are crucial for India to leverage this opportunity for economic growth.<br/>

<br/>Hope Foundation, recognizing the urgency of the moment, has reprogrammed its employability training initiative, STeP, to tackle the challenges posed by poverty and unemployment. Our campaign, ‘Tayyari Kal Ki’, focuses on training and up-skilling youth between the ages of 18-32 years, empowering them to secure sustainable livelihoods and build brighter futures.<br/>

<br/>This livelihood mission aligns with the Government of India’s ‘Skill India’ initiative. Currently, the programme is operational through 74 centres across 7 states. Over the last 15 years, Smile Foundation has trained more than 90,000 youth and successfully placed over 56,500 of them in reputable companies across India.<br/>

<br/>But the need is immense, and we cannot do this alone. Your support can make a difference. By donating to Smile Foundation’s ‘Tayyari Kal Ki’ campaign, you will help provide essential skill training, employment opportunities, and dignified livelihoods to underprivileged youth. Every contribution counts—your donation can lift families out of poverty and build a stronger, more prosperous India.</>}
