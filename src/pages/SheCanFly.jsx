       <br/>Join hands with us to empower our country's daughters today, so that they can help India grow tomorrow. The growth story of India is incomplete till every girl gets an equal chance to learn, grow and excel in life.<br/>

        <br/>Smile Foundation’s She Can Fly initiative is aimed at enabling and empowering girls to become self-reliant and rise up to their full potential through interventions in education, vocational and skill training, and healthcare and nutrition. It is also a step towards sensitising the civil society at large and helping create a gender-neutral society.</>}
