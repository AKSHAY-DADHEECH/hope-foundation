    description={<>Over the past decades, gender equality has been recognized as crucial not only to the health of nations but also to their social and economic development. The promotion of gender equality and women empowerment is a key aspect of UNDP’s Sustainable Development Goals.<br/>

<br/>A community, society, and country prosper when its women are empowered. Skilled women join India’s workforce and contribute to economy; healthy women lay down the foundation for healthy families; aware mothers ensure that their children go to school; empowered women become change makers and support other women.<br/>

<br/>Hope Foundation’s women empowerment programme Swabhiman, initiated in 2005, reaches out to marginalised and socially excluded women with interventions in nutrition, healthcare and livelihood.<br/>

<br/>At the heart of Swabhiman lies the 4S approach:<br/>

<br/>Sensitisation to Adopt Health Seeking Behaviour: Encouraging women to actively seek healthcare and prioritize their well-being.<br/>
Supporting for Livelihood: Equipping women with skills and resources to achieve financial independence.<br/>
Supporters in Men through Male Involvement: Engaging men as allies in promoting gender equality and supporting women’s empowerment.<br/>
Sustaining Change in Communities: Creating long-lasting positive changes within communities by empowering women.<br/>
<br/>By supporting Swabhiman, you can help break the cycle of poverty and inequality for countless women and families. Your contribution will enable Smile Foundation to continue its efforts in empowering women, equipping them with skills, and ensuring access to essential healthcare. Together, we can create a more equitable and thriving society. Join us in making a lasting impact—empower a woman today and transform generations to come</>}
