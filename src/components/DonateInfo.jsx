      <h2>Education is Every Child’s Right</h2>

      <p>
        Education is every child's right — it’s the foundation for a secure,
        dignified, and fulfilling life. But for countless children in India,
        this simple dream remains out of reach.
      </p>

      <p>
        Poverty, lack of awareness, and social inequalities often force children
        out of classrooms and into child labour, early marriages, or other unsafe
        situations.
      </p>

      <p>
        At Hope Foundation, we believe that no child should have to choose
        between survival and school. Through our <strong>‘Shiksha Na Ruke’</strong>
        initiative, we are ensuring learning never stops.
      </p>

      <p>
        Currently, we are empowering more than <strong>160,000 children</strong>
        across <strong>27 states</strong>, helping them step into a future full
        of hope and opportunity.
      </p>

      <p>
        Our education centres are safe spaces where children learn, grow,
        develop life skills, and build confidence — supported by parents,
        teachers, and communities.
      </p>

      <p className="highlight">
        Your support can keep children in school and away from child labour
        and exploitation.
